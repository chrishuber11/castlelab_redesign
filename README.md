Abstract:
The project objectives were set with these key ideas: resourcefulness,
ease of use, safety, and aesthetics. The project was first implemented
as a blueprint in the Figma program, which allowed for a creative view
of the aesthetics, interface, and functions necessary to create the struc-
ture and design for the website. This blueprint laid the foundations
for the final work: a Django back-end framework, a SQLite database
structure, Python functions and logic control, and an HTML and CSS
front-end. The main features implemented into the website’s final de-
sign include a working form to request a talk at the next CASTLE
meeting, a redesign of the visuals and representation of CASTLE’s
identity with a new logo, an easy-to-navigate archive of every previous
meeting held by CASTLE, a page to show every project completed
or currently completed by CASTLE students, and finally a page to
view every event or competition CASTLE has hosted. This resulted
in a complete and detailed website that is fast, coherent, creative, and
meaningful to use. Cultivating the core design aspects, from front-
end to back-end, has created a deep full-stack development website for
many years that is formulated to be maintained by anyone.
